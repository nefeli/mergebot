# mergebot
An opinionated mergebot for GitHub Actions using a rebase workflow

inspired by https://github.com/tibdex/autosquash

Currently a work in progress. See example.yml for an example workflow.

If you'd like to use this, you'll need to make a github app to work as a dummy
authentication source. See example.yml.
